Setting up Python on your computer

1. install VScode and open it.

2. on the left hand side hover over and click on the extensions tab

3. install the following extensions:
- Code Runner by Don Jayamanne
- Python by Microsoft
- Plance by Microsoft
- Python Debugger by Microsoft
- Python Environments by Microsoft
- pip installer by Peter Steiner
- Pip Manager by slightc
- Python Auto Venv by WolfiesHorizon
- Python Indent by Kevin Rose

4. pull from https://github.com/MoonLight693/USCCB-Manuscript and trust it.

5. On the top of VScode select View -> Command Palette...
- This will open a small terminal at the top of the screen
- type in Python: Select Interpreter or select it from the drop down
- then select the .venv option and any python packages in the requirements.txt 
should not give you any more errors

6. (for updating the requirements.txt with the right packages as they are currently installed)
- use the command: pip --isolated freeze > requirements.txt
in the terminal

installing virtual Environments
the .gitignore should prevent you from uploading your Environments,
so you only need to reinstall each time.
